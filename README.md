## About

Basically, I'm sick of putting all this crap together at the start of each project - as you should be! Use this to your advantage if you'd like. It's just a really barebones Wordpress theme leveraging technologies such as SASS, Gulp and Bower.

Take care to remember that this theme is in early and active development, so things might suck for you at first.

## Starter Theme + HTML Framework = WordPress Theme Framework

The _s theme is a good starting point to develop a WordPress theme. But it is “just” a raw starter theme. That means it outputs all the WordPress stuff correctly but without any layout or design.
Why not add a well known and supported layout framework to have a solid, clean and responsive foundation? That’s where Bootstrap comes in.

## SASS

Go ahead and customize the theme on top of Bootstrap styles by adding your own custom SCSS to the custom folder (./src/sass/custom/*).

## Installation

- Download the .zip of the project here
